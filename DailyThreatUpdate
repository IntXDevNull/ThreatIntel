#Copy the code into a new file named <filename>.py.
#Make the file executable by running the command: chmod +x <filename>.py.
#Run the code by executing the command: ./<filename>.py urls.txt. Replace urls.txt with the file containing the list of URLs. You can either use the provided urls.txt file from this repository or create your own list of URLs.
#This script will open each URL in a separate tab in Chromium. Adjustments to the execution speed can be made within the script itself if necessary.
